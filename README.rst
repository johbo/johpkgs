That's my package collection based on Nix, mainly serves two purposes:

* Manage a shared set of configuration files to use on different machines, by
  installing `johbo-config`.

* Provide custom packages which are not ni `nixpkgs`.


Dependencies
============

* Needs the Nix package manager, make sure to check out http://nixos.org and
  set it up.

* Needs a recent version of `nixpkgs`, at least follow the unstable channel. If
  that's not recent enough, either wait or use the `master` branch of
  `nixpkgs`.
